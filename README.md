# Mathematics for Machine learning!

- In this repository ,I have provided the code snippets from the NPTEL course 'Essential mathematics for machine learning'.
- As the name suggests the course provides some of the Mathematical tools and concepts required for machine learning and also provides Mathematical underpinnings for some of the ML algorithms.
- the code here is heavily commented ,and in addition I have also provided some explainations for some of the concepts....

## here are the topics covered !

**Week 1** : Vectors in Machine Learning, Basics of Matrix Algebra,Vector Space, Subspace, Basis and Dimension.

**Week 2** : Linear Transformations, Norms and Spaces, Orthogonal Complement and Projection Mapping, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Special Matrices and Properties. + _python code_

**Week 3** : Spectral Decomposition, Singular Value Decomposition,Low Rank Approximations, Python Implementation of SVD and Low-rank Approximation. + _python code_

**Week 4** : Principal Component Analysis,Python Implementation of PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Python Implementation of LDA.+ _python code_

**Week 5** : Least Square Approximation and Minimum Normed Solution, Linear and Multiple Regression, Logistic Regression. + _python code_

**Week 6**: Classification Metrics, Gram Schmidt Process, Polar Decomposition, Minimal Polynomial and Jordan Canonical Form, Some more Matrices Applications in Machine Leaning. + python codes

**Week 7** : Basics concepts of Calculus, gradient, Jacobian, Chain rule,Change of variables.

**Week 8** : Calculus in Python, Convex sets and convex functions, properties of convex functions, Introduction to Optimization.+ _python code_

**Week 9** : Numerical Optimization in Machine Learning, Gradient Descent and other optimization algorithms in machine learning.+ _python code_
