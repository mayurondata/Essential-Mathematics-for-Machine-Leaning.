- In this repository ,I have provided the code snippets from the NPTEL course 'Essential mathematics for machine learning'.
- As the name suggests the course provides some of the Mathematical tools and concepts required for machine learning and also provides Mathematical underpinnings for some of the ML algorithms.
- the code here is heavily commented ,and I have also provided some explainations for the concepts
- Hope you enjoy learning Math as I do !
